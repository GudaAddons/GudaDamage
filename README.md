# GudaDamage

A World of Warcraft addon that lets you customize the floating combat damage font.

## Features

- **10 built-in fonts** — Default (Blizzard), NiceDamage, Bungee, Diablo, Friz Quadrata, Nosifer, Butcherman, Manufacturing, Monoton, Frijole
- **Live preview** — see how each font looks before saving
- **Damage scale slider** — adjust the size of floating damage numbers (0.5x – 3.0x)
- **Draggable minimap button** — quick access to settings, can be hidden
- **Multi-version support** — works on Classic, Cata, Retail, and Anniversary editions

## Usage

- `/gd` or `/gudadamage` — open the settings panel
- Click the minimap button to toggle settings
- Drag the minimap button around the minimap to reposition it

## Note

After changing the damage font, you must **log out to the character select screen** for the new font to take effect. A simple `/reload` is not sufficient — the game engine caches the damage font at login.
